# Applying Puppet manifests

You can use Bolt to apply blocks of Puppet code, called manifest blocks, to
remote targets.

You can create manifest blocks that use existing content from the Forge, or mix
declarative resource configuration via manifest blocks with procedural
orchestration and action in a plan. Most features of the Puppet language are
available in a manifest block: classes, custom resource types, and functions.
For information about what language features aren't supported, see [Manifest
block limitations](#manifest-block-limitations).

> ðŸ”© **Tip:** If you installed Bolt as a Ruby Gem, make sure you have installed
  the core modules required to use the `puppet apply` command. These modules are
  listed in the [Bolt GitHub
  repository](https://github.com/puppetlabs/bolt/blob/master/Puppetfile) and you
  can install them using a Puppetfile.

## Applying manifest blocks from the command line

Similar to the [`puppet apply`
command](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/man/apply.html), which applies a
standalone Puppet manifest to a local system, the [`bolt apply`
command](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_command_reference.html#apply)
uses manifest blocks to pass code to remote targets from the command line.

Manifest blocks require facts to compile. When using the `bolt apply` command,
Bolt will automatically install the packages necessary to run the apply command,
and gathers facts using [facter](https://puppet.com/docs/facter/latest/), making
the facts available to the manifest block. Bolt will also identify targets that
do not have Puppet agents and run the [`puppet_agent::install`
task](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) to install the agent.

> **Note:** The Puppet agent package is installed to enable the use of Puppet
  code. It does not require setting up an agent-master architecture between the
  remote systems and the local system running Bolt.

### Applying manifest files

You can specify an existing manifest file to apply Puppet code from by passing
an absolute path to the manifest file as an argument to the `bolt apply`
command:

```shell
$ bolt apply ~/bolt/site-modules/profiles/manifests/server.pp -t target1,target2
```

### Applying manifest code

You can pass manifest code directly to the `bolt apply` command using the
`[-e|--execute]` option. This option takes a string containing manifest code:

```shell
$ bolt apply -e "file { '/etc/puppetlabs': ensure => present }" -t target1,target2
```

### Definitions and declarations

When applying manifest blocks, it's important to understand the distinction
between _definitions_ and _declarations_. 

Definitions, which include class definitions and defined resource types, are
blocks of Puppet code that can be used when called by name. Defining a class or
defined type makes the code available to a catalog, but does not add it to the
catalog. A class or defined type that is not called by name, or _declared_, is
not added to the catalog, and thus none of the code in those definitions will be
applied to the targets.

When using the `bolt apply` command to apply a manifest containing only
definitions, Bolt will issue a helpful warning to let you know that the apply
will do nothing:

```shell
$ bolt apply -e "define bolt { file { 'etc/puppetlabs': ensure => present } }" -t target1,target2

Manifest only contains definitions and will result in no changes on the targets.
. . .
```

  classes](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_classes.html)
- [Defining and declaring defined
  types](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_defined_types.html)

### How manifest blocks are applied

Bolt compiles the code in your manifest block into a catalog. Bolt compiles code
in the following order:

- Facts gathered from the targets or set in your inventory.
- [`vars`](inventory_file_v2.md#title-1541705359297) set in your inventory.

Like the code compiled with the `puppet apply` command, all of the variables are
generated. As a result, you can reuse code between Bolt and Puppet. Bolt then
copies custom module content from the module path to the targets and applies the
catalog using Puppet.

After the catalog compiles and is executed successfully on all targets, `bolt
apply` displays the reports generated by applying the catalog on each target.

### Return value

When you run the command, Bolt will first install required packages and gather
facts, apply the catalog compiled from the manifest blocks, and then report a
summary of any changes made on the remote systems:

```shell
Starting: install puppet and gather facts on target1, target2
Finished: install puppet and gather facts with 0 failures in 3.81 sec
Starting: apply catalog on target1, target2
Started on target1...
Started on target2...
Finished on target1:
  changed: 1, failed: 0, unchanged: 0, skipped: 0, noop: 0
Finished on target2:
  changed: 1, failed: 0, unchanged: 0, skipped: 0, noop: 0
Finished: apply catalog with 0 failures in 4.52 sec
Successful on 2 targets: target1,target2
Ran on 2 targets in 8.42 sec
```

## Applying manifest blocks from a plan

In addition to the `bolt apply` command, you can apply manifest blocks to remote
systems during plan execution using the `apply` function.

Manifest blocks require facts to compile. If your plan includes a manifest
block, use the `apply_prep` function in your plan _before_ your manifest block.
The `apply_prep` function installs the packages necessary to run the apply
command and gathers facts by running
[facter](https://puppet.com/docs/facter/latest/), making the facts available to
the manifest block. The `apply_prep` function also identifies the targets that
do not have Puppet agents and runs the [`puppet_agent::install`
task](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppet_agent) to install the agent.

> **Note:** The Puppet agent package is installed to enable the use of Puppet
  code. It does not require setting up an agent-master architecture between the
  remote systems and the local system running Bolt.

### Options

The `apply` function supports the following options:

- `_catch_errors => true` returns a `ResultSet` including failed results, rather
  than failing the plan.

- `_description => <DESCRIPTION>` adds a description to the apply block,
  allowing you to distinguish apply blocks.

- `_noop => true` applies the manifest block in Puppet no-operation mode,
  returning a report of the changes it would make, but takes no action.

- `_run_as => <USER>` applies the manifest block as the specified user. (This
  option is for transports that allow a user to run commands under a different
  username.)

```puppet
# Preview installing docker as root on $targets.
apply($targets, _catch_errors => true, _noop => true, _run_as => root) {
    include 'docker'
}
```

### How manifest blocks are applied

Bolt compiles the code in your manifest block into a catalog. Bolt compiles code
in the following order:

- Facts gathered from the targets or set in your inventory.
- Local variables from the plan.
- [`vars`](inventory_file_v2.md#title-1541705359297) set in your inventory.

Like the code compiled with the `puppet apply` command, all the variables are
generated. As a result, you can reuse code between Bolt and Puppet. Bolt then
copies custom module content from the Bolt module path to the targets and
applies the catalog using Puppet.

After the catalog compiles and is executed successfully on all targets, `apply`
returns the reports generated by applying the catalog on each target.

### Return value

The `apply` function returns a [`ResultSet`
object](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_types_reference.html#resultset)
that contains an [`ApplyResult`
object](https://puppet.com/docs/bolt/latest/bolt_types_reference.html#applyresult)
for each target. 

```puppet
$results = apply($targets) { ... }
$results.each |$result| {
   notice($result.report)
}
```

## Configuring concurrency

Each target requires a separate catalog be compiled with its unique `facts` and
`vars`. The apply action compiles and applies catalogs in parallel on the Bolt
host. Concurrency of catalog compilation is controlled by the
`compile-concurrency` config option. This option is limited to twice the number
of threads your CPU can run concurrently. Catalog application, on the other
hand, uses the Bolt default thread pool controlled by the `concurrency` option.

## Using Hiera data in a manifest block

Use [Hiera](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/hiera_intro.html) to separate
configuration from context-specific data, where context may be fact-based or the
name of a target.

> **Note:** Only Hiera version 5 is supported in Bolt.

Hiera is a key-value configuration data lookup system, used for separating data
from Puppet code. You use Hiera data to implicitly override default class
parameters. You can also explicitly lookup data from Hiera via the [`lookup`
function](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/function.html#lookup):

```puppet
plan do_thing() {
  apply('localhost') {
    notice("Some data in Hiera: ${lookup('mydata')}")
  }
}
```

Manifest block compilation can access Hiera data that you add to your Bolt
configuration. The default location for Hiera config is `$BOLTDIR/hiera.yaml`.
You can change this with the `hiera-config` key in a Bolt config file or the
`--hiera-config` CLI option.

Following the Hiera 5 convention, the default data dir is relative to
`hiera.yaml` at `$BOLTDIR/data`. For configfile examples, see [Configuring
Hiera](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/hiera_config_yaml_5.html).

The target name is made available to hiera via the `certname` key of the `$trusted` top level Puppet variable, ie `$trusted['certname']`. This can be interpolated in hierarchy paths within `$BOLTDIR/hiera.yaml` using `%{trusted.certname}`.

```yaml
    paths:
      - "targets/%{trusted.certname}.yaml"
```

If a custom data provider is used, such as `hiera-eyaml`, which allows you to
encrypt your data, the gem dependencies must be available to Bolt. See [Install
gems with Bolt packages](bolt_installing.md#).

## Available plan functions

In addition to the standard Puppet functions available to a catalog, such as
`lookup`, you can use the following Bolt functions in a manifest block:

- [`puppetdb_query`](plan_functions.md#puppetdb_query)
- [`puppetdb_facts`](plan_functions.md#puppetdb_facts)
- [`facts`](plan_functions.md#facts)
- [`vars`](plan_functions.md#vars)

## Manifest block limitations

Exported resources are not supported in manifest blocks. You must pass exported
resources directly instead of exporting and collecting them from PuppetDB. If
you need to interact with resources managed during a normal run, use the
[`puppetdb_query` function](plan_functions.md#puppetdb_query).

In addition, the following top-level variables, which exist in normal catalog
compilation, are not included during manifest block compilation:

- `$server_facts`
- Master variables like `$servername`
- `$environment`

You can optionally set these from a target's `vars`, but they don't have
defaults in Bolt.

## Examples

### Create a sample manifest for nginx on Linux

Create a manifest that sets up a web server with nginx, and run it as a plan.

1.  Go to the `site-modules` directory in the default Bolt project directory:
    `~/.puppetlabs/bolt/site-modules`

1.  Create a module named profiles.
    -   If you use the Puppet Development Kit: `pdk new module profiles`
    -   Otherwise create `~/.puppetlabs/bolt/site-modules/profiles`

1.  Add a `plans` directoryÂ to the profiles module.

1.  In the plans directory, create a manifest file called `nginx_install.pp` and
    add the following code:

    ```puppet
    plan profiles::nginx_install(
         TargetSpec $targets,
         String $site_content = 'hello!',
       ) {

         # Install the puppet-agent package if Puppet is not detected.
         # Copy over custom facts from the Bolt module path.
         # Run the `facter` command line tool to gather target information.
         $targets.apply_prep

         # Compile the manifest block into a catalog
         apply($targets) {
           if($facts['os']['family'] == 'redhat') {
             package { 'epel-release':
               ensure => present,
               before => Package['nginx'],
             }
             $html_dir = '/usr/share/nginx/html'
           } else {
             $html_dir = '/var/www/html'
           }

           package {'nginx':
             ensure => present,
           }

           file {"${html_dir}/index.html":
             content => $site_content,
             ensure  => file,
           }

           service {'nginx':
             ensure  => 'running',
             enable  => 'true',
             require => Package['nginx']
           }
         }
       }
    ```

1.  Run the plan on a target:

    ```shell
    bolt plan run profiles::nginx_install --targets mytarget.mydomain
    ```

1.  In a web browser, open `mytarget.mydomain`. The page displays the text
    `hello!`

> ðŸ”© **Tip:** For complex web server deployments, consider adding the
  [puppet-nginx](https://forge.puppet.com/puppet/nginx)Â module.

## Using Puppet device modules from an apply statement

Puppet device modules based on remote transports allow network devices and other
targets that can't run a Puppet agent to be managed from a proxy.

> **Note:** Support for device modules is experimental and might change in
> future minor (y) releases.

To use device modules from an apply statement, the devices must be added to the
Bolt inventory as remote targets. The `name` of the target will be used to
auto-populate the `name`, `uri`, `user`, `password`, `host`, and `port` fields
of the remote transport's connnection info. You must set the `remote-transport`
option and any other connnection info under the `remote` section of config.

```yaml
targets:
  - name: "https://username:password@panos-device.example.com"
    config:
      transport: remote
      remote:
        remote-transport: panos
```

When you set the `run-on` option with a device module, the `puppet-resource_api`
Gem must be installed with the Puppet agent on the proxy target and it must be
version 1.8.1 or later.
